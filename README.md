This app (currently nameless) is a simple social networking app.

## How to use

Log as user `bob` with password `bob`. The main screen has 4 tabs: Friend 
feed, followers, following, and me/settings.

The friend feed shows yours and your friends posts. You can tap new post 
(+ in the top right) to draft a new post. You can tap on a post to see what 
your friends have said about it, and make a reply of your own (reply button at
 the bottom of replies).

The followers/following pages show who's following you, and who you are 
following. You can tap a user to see their details, and follow that user with 
the press of a button. You can click the search button to find users too.

The Me page shows your details. Tapping on each detail allows you to edit it. 
From here you can also log out.
